## Overview

This project was done for ENGR 330 Test 2 at the University of St. Thomas.  
The goal was to design and compare three different N-bit adder architectures using Verilog and test them in Vivado.

Adders implemented:
- Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)
- Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)
- Prefix Adder

Each adder was parameterized, simulated, and synthesized to compare speed and resource usage.
